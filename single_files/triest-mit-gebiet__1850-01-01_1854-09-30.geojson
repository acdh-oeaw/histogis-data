The data set from 1835 was adopted and modified so that it corresponds to the counties of the period from 1850 - 1854. Moreover, data from the Census Mosaic Project (http://www.censusmosaic.org/) was used to add missing information to the attribute table. All counties were checked (in particular with regard to dates of existence) by means of historical legislative texts provided by the Austrian National Library, available online through ALEX: http://alex.onb.ac.at/. Other helpful sources were diploma theses on the territorial development of the former crown lands of the Habsburg Monarchy (see quoted below).\r\n\r\nTo improve spatial accuracy, data provided by the \u00a9 OpenStreetMap collaborative project (www.openstreetmap.org) and georeferenced historical maps were used.  The historical maps also served as sources of names.\r\n\r\nThe starting date of the circles dates back to the new political division from 1849. Ending dates come along with another political reform which took place in 1854. Although some district authorities were dissolved earlier. Start - and end dates refer to the listed laws.\r\n\r\nSmaller crown lands were not divided into circles, in order to obtain a complete data set these are included in the data set. This affects the following crown lands: K\u00e4rnten, Krain, Schlesien, Bukowina, Salzburg, \u00d6sterreich ob der Enns, \u00d6sterreich unter der Enns, Dalmatien, Kroatien und Slawonien\r\n\r\nRemark: The reconstruction of some borders turned out to be very difficult due to a lack of information and small scale maps. In case of doubt, the reconstructed border line refers to the cited historical map.\r\n\r\nOnly few sources are available for Hungary, the Hungarian crown lands and the military border, so there are no exact start and end dates. Legal texts could not be found. The borders are based on a map by Carl Flemming (Rumsey: Flemming, Ungarn, 1855).\r\n\r\nAnna Piechl was responsible for data vectorization, consolidation and harmonization, and for data amendment and editing based on research by Peter Paul Marckhgott-Sanabria and Norbert Czirjak.\r\nPeter Paul Marckhgott-Sanabria was responsible for historical investigation and validation, in particular for reviewing the created data sets and for research on administrative structures in the time period and on the dates of existence of the respective administrative units (time spans between formation and disintegration).", "lang": "en"}], "@id": "https://histogis.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/shapes/permalink/ca05dc3448191a19337c4821ed6177e6/"}
