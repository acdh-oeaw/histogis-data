For this purpose the map sheets were first georeferenced and then manually vectorized. For some crown lands, additional georeferenced maps were used for the adjustment of the boundaries - see quotations below. Whereby some maps were only used for visual comparison and to coutnercheck the borders. The names of the circles and the capital cities were largely taken from the map of Floder.  \r\n\r\nIn order to harmonize the data set with the HistoGIS data to a large extent, the boundaries were adapted to the already existing HistoGIS shapefile 'cisleithanien_adm4_districts_1868'.\r\nTo improve spatial accuracy, data provided by the \u00a9 OpenStreetMap collaborative project (www.openstreetmap.org) was used as a basemap.  \r\n\r\nThe starting date of the circles refers to the Congress of Vienna which took place from 18 September 1814 to 11 June 1815 (official end) (https://www.geschichtewiki.wien.gv.at/Wiener_Kongress_%281814/1815%29). The end date of the county division for this record dates back to the new political division from 1849. The Counties (Kreise) in this form existed roughly from 1748 until 1860 although there were some changes.  \r\n\r\nRemark: The reconstruction of some borders turned out to be very difficult due to a lack of additional information to the structure of the counties and the low spatial accuracy of the map bases. This applies, for example, to the eastern part of Galicia and parts of Transylvania.  \r\n\r\nAnna Piechl was responsible for data vectorization, consolidation and harmonization, and for data amendment and editing based on research by Peter Paul Marckhgott-Sanabria.\r\nPeter Paul Marckhgott-Sanabria was responsible for historical investigation and validation, in particular for reviewing the created data sets and for research on administrative structures in the time period and on the dates of existence of the respective administrative units (time spans between formation and disintegration).", "lang": "en"}], "links": [{"type": "skos:closeMatch", "identifier": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q6006584"}], "@id": "https://histogis.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/shapes/permalink/026fc9aa27dcaf6b784da158a37ced53/"}
